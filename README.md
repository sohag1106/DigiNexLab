# DigiNexLab - Starter Project


This is a static starter template for DigiNexLab using HTML, Tailwind (Play CDN), Bootstrap (CDN), and vanilla JS.


## How to use
1. Copy the files into a directory (preserve folders).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Replace `INSERT_NUMBER` in `index.html` with your WhatsApp number (international format) for chat.
4. To add real image assets, download images to `assets/images/` and update `src` paths.


## Optional improvements
- Switch Tailwind to a build process for a production-ready workflow.
- Hook contact form to Formspree or a server endpoint.
- Add sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and analytics when ready.

If you want, I can now:
- Generate each page as separate image mockups (we already made Home).
- Export these files as a downloadable .zip (if you want I can prepare a zip file here).
- Start implementing the **full HTML/CSS/JS code** locally and push it to a GitHub repo (you provide details) — or I can continue generating the remaining pages' full HTML now.
