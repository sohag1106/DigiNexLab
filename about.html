These pages use the same header/footer and layout conventions. The `contact.html` includes a simple contact form (Name, Email, Message) that posts to `#` by default. Copy the pattern shown in `index.html` / `services.html` and replace page content. The project uses static HTML so you may wire the contact form to an email provider (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or server endpoint) later.
